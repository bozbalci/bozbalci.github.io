I've spent most of my life around computers. Having chosen a career in computer science and software engineering, I assume that I will spend the majority of the rest of my life in the same way. In this post I tell the story of how I was introduced to computers, how my interests grew over the years, and how I ended up in this field.

# Early years

Our first home computer was bought in the early 2000s, and it ran Windows 98. It had a gigantic ergonomic keyboard designed by Microsoft. My mother told me that when I was three, I struck some keys on the keyboard and identified some letters as they appeared on the screenâ€”that was how I learned the shape of some letters before ever holding a pencil.

It is 2001

[^1]: I doubt this story, but I like to think that it's true because it allows me to say that I've been typing before I could write. :p
