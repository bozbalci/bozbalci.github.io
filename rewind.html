        <h2>Rewind</h2>
        <p>Last updated: 2018-02-23.</p>
        <p>In this page, I maintain a list of (mostly technology related) terms like “rewind”, which are still used every day, even though they have lost their original meaning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>bug</em> (computing): An error or flaw in a computer program. The first bug was a moth trapped in an electromechanical computer. The bug was carefully removed and taped to a log book. (See also debugging).</li>
            <li><em>burning and dodging</em> (in photography): These are tools in Photoshop to manipulate the exposure of selected areas in a photo. The terms originate from actual <a href="https://en.gowikipedia.org/wiki/Dodging_and_burning">dark room processes.</a></li>
            <li><em>car</em>: Short for carriage.</li>
            <li><em>carbon copy</em> (e-mail): The common abbreviation is CC. A copy of the e-mail is sent to some other people in th CC list. In the typewriter days, a sheet of carbon stained paper was placed between two pages so that the letters typed on the first page were copied onto the second page.</li>
            <li><em>clip art</em> (documents): Refers to drawings that came in a book full of stock images. Users would <em>clip</em> out images with scissors and place them onto a page.</li>
            <li><em>cut and paste</em> (software): The older practice was to physically cut up paper with text on it and glue it back on a new place.</li>
            <li><em>dashboard</em>: A panel under the windscreen of a car or aircraft, containing indicator dials, compartments and sometimes controls. Also, it’s used to refer to data visualiations on user interfaces. The oldschool meaning refers to a barrier of wood to protect the carriage from mud and dirt dashed up by the hooves of the horse.</li>
            <li><em>dial</em> (a number): Originates from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_dial"><em>rotary dial.</em></a> The digits used to be arranged in a circular layout, and you would rotate the wheel.</li>
            <li><em>flashing</em> (in electronics): As in “flashing the BIOS”. Back in the day, with EPROM chips, you’d peel back a sticker so that the chip would be exposed to UV light, allowing it to be reprogammed.</li>
            <li><em>floppy disk icon</em>: Commonly used as an icon of saving. Floppy disks are not commonly used anymore.</li>
            <li><em>footage</em>: Today it’s used to describe videos. In the good old days, it was a measurement of the length of the film (in feet).</li>
            <li><em>hang up the phone:</em> Refers to the termination of a phone call. Back in the day, phones were wall mounted and you would hang up the phone on the wall fixture after a call.</li>
            <li><em>icon</em>: The original meaning is a small representation of Jesus or a saint.</li>
            <li><em>Italic type</em> (in typography): <em>Italic type was first designed in Italy.</em></li>
            <li><em>patch</em> (in computing): Refers to a piece of software that aims to update a program to fix bugs or improve it. The first patches were physical patches on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_tape">punched tapes.</a></li>
            <li><em>podcast</em>: A portmanteau of “iPod” (an Apple media player) and “broadcast”.</li>
            <li><em>press</em>: As in news organizations. Such news organizations are still called “press” even though printing press is no longer being used.</li>
            <li><em>rolling up/down a window</em>: Refers to manual car windows that were rolled using a handle.</li>
            <li><em>soap opera</em>: A serial drama on TV or the radio that focuses on emotional relationships. They were usually sponsored by soap manufacturers. The association is no longer present, but the name has stuck.</li>
            <li><em>track</em> (music): Used when referring to songs. In the days of the vinyl record, songs were recorded on tracks (i.e. grooves) in the record’s surface.</li>
            <li><em>trailer</em> (as in movie trailers): Commercial for a movie that will be released in the future. It’s called a “trail”er because originally they were shown at the end of screening. This practice didn’t last long because people left the theater after the movies ended, but the name has stuck.</li>
            <li><em>turning lights on and off</em>: Probably originates from the time where gaslights were controlled by a valve which you would turn.</li>
            <li><em>uppercase and lowercase</em> (in typography): Uppercase letters are ABC, lowercase letters are abc. In printing press, each glyph was a die that was placed in a frame, then inked and pressed on a paper. Those dies are stored in drawers or cases. The capital letters were in the top drawers (upper case) and lowercase letters were in the bottom drawers.</li>
            <li><em>we’re rolling</em> (idiom, cinema): Used when recording footage. Refers to the film rolling in the camera.</li>
