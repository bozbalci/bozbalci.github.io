I'm Berk Özbalcı, a 18-year-old {math,programming,music} enthusiast living in İzmir, Turkey. Currently studying Computer Engineering at Middle East Technical University An alumnus of Bornova Anatolian High School.

I have a fairly well understanding of mathematical concepts and I like to share them with my friends. I like reading undergraduate level mathematical textbooks, and I am currently reading a book on group theory.

I enjoy programming, and I will pursue a career in computer science. I have experience with C, C# and Python, and I have a little familiarity with C++ and Perl.

I {listen to,play} a lot of music. Nowadays I am listening to a lot of jazz fusion, progressive rock and late Romantic era classical music. I play the classical guitar, and I can play a few tunes on the flute (which I will practise harder when I have the time to!).

I watch a lot of TV shows. I am a big fan of Chuck, and I am ready to donate for its revival. I am currently following Doctor Who, Silicon Valley and Better Call Saul.

About my setup
--------------

I am running a fairly old desktop computer with specifications not worth mentioning, and from time to time a Mac Mini 2005 (one of the PowerPC models!) with Debian installed. My main machine runs Debian 8.1, and I use bspwm & sxhkd on X.org for window management. I play my music through mpd & ncmpcpp, and I am a proud user of the rxvt-unicode. I prefer zsh over bash. My text editor of choice is Vim, I've tried using Emacs but found it too detailed for a text editor.

Also there are software which dump euphoria to /dev/brain, that I enjoy using casually:

* audacity
* beets
* feh
* lilypond
* mplayer
* newsbeuter
* w3m

I also use my own scripts (artget, hiii, patron) from time to time. All of them can be found at my [GitHub account][gh-account].
