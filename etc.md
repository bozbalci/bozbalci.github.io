This is a catch-all type of a page which lists content that doesn't really belong anywhere else.

* Original music compositions can be found [here.][mymusic]
* My digital art (3D renders, posters, etc.) can be found at my [Instagram][instagram] profile.
* [Rewind][rewind], a glossary of terms that have lost their core relevance, but are still used today.
* (No longer maintained) The project page for [L'oiseau][oiseau], a Last.fm scrobbler for MPD, written in Python.
